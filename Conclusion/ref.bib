Many combinatorially interesting sets give rise to codes with good parameters under this generic construction.

In this paper we prove four of these conjectures (Conjectures 38-41).}

abstract = {This article gives new fast methods for decoding certain error-correcting codes by solving certain algebraic equations. As described by Peterson (1961), the locations of a Bose-Chaudhuri Hocquenghem code over a field of characteristic p are associated with the elements of an extension field, GF(pk). The code is designed in such a way that the weighted power-sum symmetric functions of the error locations can be obtained directly by computing appropriately chosen parity checks on the received word. Good methods for computing the elementary symmetric functions from the weighted power-sum symmetric functions have been presented by Berlekamp (1967). The elementary symmetric functions, σ1, σ2, …, σt are the coefficients of an algebraic equation whose roots are the error locations xt+σ1xt-1+σ2xt-1+⋯+σt=0 Previous methods for finding the roots of this equation have searched all of the elements in GF(pk) (Chien, 1964) or looked up the answer in a large table (Polkinghorn, 1966). We present here improved procedures for extracting the roots of algebraic equations of small degrees.}

abstract = {Recently, Beierle and Leander found two new sporadic quadratic APN permutations in dimension 9. Up to EA-equivalence, we present a single trivariate representation of those two permutations as Cu:(F2m)3→(F2m)3,(x,y,z)↦(x3+uy2z,y3+uxz2,z3+ux2y), where m=3 and u∈F23∖{0,1} such that the two permutations correspond to different choices of u. We then analyze the differential uniformity and the nonlinearity of Cu in a more general case. For m≥3 being a multiple of 3 and u∈F2m not being a 7-th power, we show that the differential uniformity of Cu is bounded above by 8, and that the linearity of Cu is bounded above by 81+⌊m2⌋. Based on numerical experiments, we conjecture that Cu is not APN if m is greater than 3. We also analyze the CCZ-equivalence classes of the quadratic APN permutations in dimension 9 known so far and derive a lower bound on the number of their EA-equivalence classes. We further show that the two sporadic APN permutations share an interesting similarity with Gold APN permutations in odd dimension divisible by 3, namely that a permutation EA-inequivalent to those sporadic APN permutations and their inverses can be obtained by just applying EA transformations and inversion to the original permutations.}
