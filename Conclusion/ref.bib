Many combinatorially interesting sets give rise to codes with good parameters under this generic construction.

In this paper we prove four of these conjectures (Conjectures 38-41).}

abstract = {This article gives new fast methods for decoding certain error-correcting codes by solving certain algebraic equations. As described by Peterson (1961), the locations of a Bose-Chaudhuri Hocquenghem code over a field of characteristic p are associated with the elements of an extension field, GF(pk). The code is designed in such a way that the weighted power-sum symmetric functions of the error locations can be obtained directly by computing appropriately chosen parity checks on the received word. Good methods for computing the elementary symmetric functions from the weighted power-sum symmetric functions have been presented by Berlekamp (1967). The elementary symmetric functions, σ1, σ2, …, σt are the coefficients of an algebraic equation whose roots are the error locations xt+σ1xt-1+σ2xt-1+⋯+σt=0 Previous methods for finding the roots of this equation have searched all of the elements in GF(pk) (Chien, 1964) or looked up the answer in a large table (Polkinghorn, 1966). We present here improved procedures for extracting the roots of algebraic equations of small degrees.}

abstract = {Recently, Beierle and Leander found two new sporadic quadratic APN permutations in dimension 9. Up to EA-equivalence, we present a single trivariate representation of those two permutations as Cu:(F2m)3→(F2m)3,(x,y,z)↦(x3+uy2z,y3+uxz2,z3+ux2y), where m=3 and u∈F23∖{0,1} such that the two permutations correspond to different choices of u. We then analyze the differential uniformity and the nonlinearity of Cu in a more general case. For m≥3 being a multiple of 3 and u∈F2m not being a 7-th power, we show that the differential uniformity of Cu is bounded above by 8, and that the linearity of Cu is bounded above by 81+⌊m2⌋. Based on numerical experiments, we conjecture that Cu is not APN if m is greater than 3. We also analyze the CCZ-equivalence classes of the quadratic APN permutations in dimension 9 known so far and derive a lower bound on the number of their EA-equivalence classes. We further show that the two sporadic APN permutations share an interesting similarity with Gold APN permutations in odd dimension divisible by 3, namely that a permutation EA-inequivalent to those sporadic APN permutations and their inverses can be obtained by just applying EA transformations and inversion to the original permutations.}

It is also important in coding theory as it is related to the covering radius of the Reed–Muller code R(r,n). In this paper we deduce the lower bounds of the second order nonlinearities of the following two types of Boolean functions: 1.fλ(x)=Tr1n(λxd) with d=22r+2r+1 and λ∈F2n∗, where n=6r.2.f(x,y)=Tr1t(xy2i+1), where x,y∈F2t,n=2t,n⩾6 and i is an integer such that 1⩽i<t,gcd(2t-1,2i+1)=1. For some λ, the functions of the first type are bent functions, whereas Boolean functions of the second type are all bent functions, i.e., they possess the maximum first order nonlinearity. It is demonstrated that in some cases our bounds are better than the previously obtained bounds.}

It plays also an important role in coding theory, since its maximum equals the covering radius of the rth-order Reed–Muller code. But it is difficult to calculate and even to bound. In this paper, we show lower bounds on the second-order nonlinearity of two subclasses of well-known bent functions. We first improve a known lower bound on the second-order nonlinearity of the simplest partial spread bent functions, whose nonlinearity profile has been bounded by the second author. This improvement allows obtaining a better bound for the whole profile. We subsequently give a lower bound on the second-order nonlinearity of some infinite class of Maiorana–McFarland (M–M) bent functions, which generalizes a result by Gangopadhyay et al.}

In one form, this measures the probability of occurrence of the differences between certain input vectors and the corresponding output vectors. For this analysis, the constituent S-boxes of a block cipher need to be studied carefully. In this direction, we derive further cryptographic properties of the multiplicative inverse function, especially the ones related to higher order differentials. This improves some theoretical results of Boukerrou et al. [ToSC 2020(1)]. Further, we prove that the multiplicative inverse function defined over F2n has an error (bias) in its second order differential spectrum with probability 12n−2, and that error occurs in more than one place. Next, we analyze the Gowers uniformity norm of S-boxes, which is also a measure connected to higher order approximations. Finally, the bounds related to the nonlinearity profile of the multiplicative inverse function are derived using both Gowers U3 norm and Walsh–Hadamard spectrum. Some of our findings here provide slightly improved bounds over the work of Carlet [IEEE-IT, 2008]. These theoretical insights might have implications towards non-randomness of a block cipher, where the multiplicative inverse function is used as a primitive.}

The second-order nonlinearity of Boolean functions also plays an important role in coding theory, since the maximal second-order nonlinearity of all Boolean functions in n variables equals the covering radius of the Reed–Muller code with length 2n and order r. It is well-known that providing a tight lower bound on the second-order nonlinearity of a general Boolean function with high algebraic degree is a hard task, excepting a few special classes of Boolean functions. In this paper, we improve the lower bounds on the second-order nonlinearity of three classes of Boolean functions of the form fi(x)=Tr1n(xdi) in n variables for i=1,2 and 3, where Tr1n denotes the absolute trace mapping from F2n to F2 and di’s are of the form (1) d1=2m+1+3 and n=2m, (2) d2=2m+2m+12+1, n=2m with odd m, and (3) d3=22r+2r+1+1 and n=4r with even r.}

  abstract="Gode, Ruchi TelangFaruqi, ShahabMishra, AshutoshNonlinearity of 2nd order is important in the study of Boolean functions from a cryptographic viewpoint. This property is useful in choosing efficient Boolean functions resisting quadratic approximation attacks. We obtain improved lower bounds with respect to the nonlinearities of 2nd order of some classes of degree 3 monomial Boolean functions of type {\$}{\$}g(x)=Tr( x^{\{}2^i+2^j+1{\}}){\$}{\$}g(x)=Tr(x2i+2j+1)(here {\$}{\$}i,j{\backslash}in {\backslash}mathbb {\{}N{\}}{\$}{\$}i,j∈N) and {\$}{\$}i {\backslash}le {\backslash}lceil {\backslash}frac{\{}n{\}}{\{}2{\}} {\backslash}rceil {\$}{\$}i≤⌈n2⌉, {\$}{\$} j {\backslash}le i{\$}{\$}j≤i. We were able to obtain these bounds in an efficacious way for Boolean functions upto 13 variables. Obtained results refine the bounds obtained by Gode and Gangopadhyay [10] and Mesnager et al. [21]. This shows the efficiency of these classes of functions with respect to nonlinearity of 2nd order.",

  abstract = {The theory of algebraic function fields has its origins in number theory, complex analysis (compact Riemann surfaces), and algebraic geometry. Since about 1980, function fields have found surprising applications in other branches of mathematics such as coding theory, cryptography, sphere packings and others. The main objective of this book is to provide a purely algebraic, self-contained and in-depth exposition of the theory of function fields. This new edition, published in the series Graduate Texts in Mathematics, has been considerably expanded. Moreover, the present edition contains numerous exercises. Some of them are fairly easy and help the reader to understand the basic material. Other exercises are more advanced and cover additional material which could not be included in the text. This volume is mainly addressed to graduate students in mathematics and theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding theory and electrical engineering.}
